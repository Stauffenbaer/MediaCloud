MediaCloud is a solution for sharing media in LAN-Networks.
The MediaCloud-Server manages a filesystem. The client can choose media to stream at a node.
A Server can manage multiple nodes. Each node is connected to an output-device (e.g. Speakers)
MediaCloud can be used to manage a home music system with multiple speakers in rooms.
