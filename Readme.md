##### What is planned?

MediaCloud is a solution for sharing media in local Networks.<br />
It allows to managing media of the server's filesystem. The client can choose between streaming media at a server-node (e.g. Speaker or Monitor) and downloading media to the local filesystem. <br />
For security-reasons MediaCloud is providing a login-system, so nobody can access media without permission of the administrator.
